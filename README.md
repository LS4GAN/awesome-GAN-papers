# Awesome GAN papers

By all means, this is not a complete list of GAN-related papers.  We are
specifically looking for generative modeling techniques to bridge the gap
between two domains, something similar to the CycleGAN. This repo also includes
historical important GAN papers, their difficulties in training,
and various techniques to overcome such difficulties and improve the performance.

## GANs between domains

## Classic GANs
In chronological order. 

- [x] [GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf)
- [x] [GAN Tutorial](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.00160.pdf)
- [ ] [CGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784)
- [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
- [WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)

## The other side of the coin
It is hard to find a paper dedicated on the failures of the GAN techniques.  But
some papers may have some content describing what problems the previous GAN
has.

## The details matter
There are many techniques to improve GAN's performance. And some of them are
tried and true.

## Implementations

## Fun Reads

- [Gwern's blog](gwern.net/)

## Under consideration

- [Graph Generative Adversarial Networks for Sparse Data Generation in High Energy Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00173) Using GAN as a "fast simulation" to replace Geant4.  While this is not a goal of LS4GAN the use of sparse data on graphs may be a useful technique to handle LS4GAN's anticipated large but sparse events.
