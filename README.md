# Awesome GAN papers

By all means, this is not a complete list of GAN-related papers.  We are
specifically looking for generative modeling techniques to bridge the gap
between two domains, something similar to the CycleGAN. This repo also includes
historical important GAN papers, their difficulties in training,
and various techniques to overcome such difficulties and improve the performance.

## The other side of the coin
It is hard to find a paper dedicated on the failures of the GAN techniques.  But
some papers may have some content describing what problems the previous GAN
has.

tried and true.
